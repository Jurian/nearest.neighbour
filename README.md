## Using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model to interpolate non-overlapping datasets in time and space

## Motivation

This package was developed to experiment with KNN in combination with weather data. This was done in order to see which weather parameters could be accurately interpolated.

## Contributors

Developed by Jurian Baas at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, part of master thesis in Artificial Intelligence.
